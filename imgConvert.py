# import opencv

#show image to be converted
#ask for a new size
#resize image, show it, ask if it's good

#if the new image size is good:
#resize the original image
#make an array with the same dims, but only 1 index deep
#for loop through original image
# - do bitwise operations, conv back to decimal, save into new array

#dump new array out to file in C const uint8_t array format
