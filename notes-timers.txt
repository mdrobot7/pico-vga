problem:
- with the color PIO state machine set up as it is, it is too slow, especially if I plan to scale to higher res
  - executing 3 instructions per loop/pixel, I can get 41.66MHz square wave out.
  - wait, is this fast enough?
  - anyway.


solution:
- link execution of the color state machine to a timer/clock generator
  - wait, if i'm linking one of them, why not just do hsync and vsync too? those would be better as timers...
  - anyway...
- at the end of a line, when the state machine asks DMA for more data, DISABLE it.
  - wait for the OSR to be empty (DMA will be triggered when the FIFO is empty, NOT the OSR), then disable
- a timer, running in the background, will reenable it when it hits the "end of the line" time
- at the end of the frame, when DMA is triggered and the currentLine is the end of the frame,
