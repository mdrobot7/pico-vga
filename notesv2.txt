                            Updated notes from a few weeks in:

The highest resolution I can do is determined by the FREQUENCY, NOT by the resolution.

Line doubling HALVES the pixel clock and buffered array size, because you are only outputting one out of every two pixels

Highest resolution: 1280x1024 @ 60Hz, 8 bit color, NOT line doubled
- Pixel clock: 108.0MHz
- Full frame size: 1,310,720 bytes (1.3Mb, ish)
- Single line size: 1024 bytes (1kb)

Single line rendering (how this would work):
- Rendering core would put sprites/"game objects" where it wants, and save the coordinates somewhere
- Every line it would output to an array the memory locations for what to put there and the size of the object 
  (number of pixels until the next object)
- Other core would ONLY be responsible for listening for DMA's callbacks
  - Start of line
    - Give DMA the first memory location and num transfers, start it
    - Wait for callback, PIO state machine outputs data to screen
    - Repeat with next memory location and size
  - End of line
  - Other core: load next line data

Full frame rendering (how the old system works):
- Two cores working on rendering
- DMA callback just loops to beginning of frame
- Start of frame
  - DMA loads frame data, chunk by chunk, into TX FIFO of PIO state machine
  - Optional, but probably necessary: Do callback halfway down frame to tell renderer it can start rendering the 
    top half of the frame out to the array
  - DMA runs out of data, triggers callback, end of visible area
  - During the VSync F. Porch, B. Porch, Sync, fill the frame with data
  - Reload DMA
- End of frame
